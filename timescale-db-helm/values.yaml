      # PostgreSQL User Name Maps
      # =========================
      #
      # Refer to the PostgreSQL documentation, chapter "Client
      # Authentication" for a complete description.  A short synopsis
      # follows.
      #
      # This file controls PostgreSQL user name mapping.  It maps external
      # user names to their corresponding PostgreSQL user names.  Records
      # are of the form:
      #
      # MAPNAME  SYSTEM-USERNAME  PG-USERNAME
      #
      # (The uppercase quantities must be replaced by actual values.)
      #
      # MAPNAME is the (otherwise freely chosen) map name that was used in
      # pg_hba.conf.  SYSTEM-USERNAME is the detected user name of the
      # client.  PG-USERNAME is the requested PostgreSQL user name.  The
      # existence of a record specifies that SYSTEM-USERNAME may connect as
      # PG-USERNAME.
      #
      # If SYSTEM-USERNAME starts with a slash (/), it will be treated as a
      # regular expression.  Optionally this can contain a capture (a
      # parenthesized subexpression).  The substring matching the capture
      # will be substituted for \1 (backslash-one) if present in
      # PG-USERNAME.
      #
      # Multiple maps may be specified in this file and used by pg_hba.conf.
      #
      # No map names are defined in the default configuration.  If all
      # system user names and PostgreSQL user names are the same, you don't
      # need anything in this file.
      #
      # This file is read on server startup and when the postmaster receives
      # a SIGHUP signal.  If you edit the file on a running system, you have
      # to SIGHUP the postmaster for the changes to take effect.  You can
      # use "pg_ctl reload" to do that.

      # Put your actual configuration here
      # ----------------------------------

      # MAPNAME       SYSTEM-USERNAME         PG-USERNAME
